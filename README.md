Crosswords

Database analysis project based on several years' worth of crossword clues and solutions from a leading British newspaper.

Includes:
 - Scraping crossword data from newspaper website
 - Importing data into mySQL database
 - Augmenting data with word frequencies in British and American English (Australian would also be fantastic but corpora are lacking)
 - Initial exploration of data set through creating dictionary/thesaurus based on solution:clue definitions
 
Could be used to answer some of the following questions:
 - Do some words crop up several times in the same week or is it just my imagination?
 - Are some crossword setters harder than others?
 - Which are the most ambiguous words going - e.g. with the most different definitions?
 - As the newspaper has tried to expand internationally, has its vocabulary become less British?
 - Which crossword setter would you least want to play Scrabble against?

A longer term exciting possibility would be automatic interpretation of cryptic crossword clues. That would be a gift I have rarely possessed.
